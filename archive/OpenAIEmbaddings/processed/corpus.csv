Book name: "" A place for us: a memoier "" book author name: ""Brandon Wolf "" summary: ""Brandon Wolf is a survivor of the Pulse nightclub shooting of 2016—a terror attack in Orlando, Florida, against the LGBTQ+ community. He is a nationally recognized public speaker and fierce activist for civil rights and gun-safety reforms. Wolf is the press secretary at Equality Florida, a civil rights nonprofit with the mission of advancing equality for the state’s LGBTQ+ community. What’s the big idea? From one of the most vital and passionate LGBTQ+ activists comes a powerful memoir about self-discovery, community, love, and resilience in the face of adversity. The 5 Key Insights: 1. Intersectionality isn’t just a buzzword. 2. You don’t have to save the world to earn your place in it. 3. Forgiveness isn’t agreeing to absolve wrongdoing, it’s an act of unconditional love. 4. Dare to love with abandon. 5. Community will save our lives. 1. Intersectionality isn’t just a buzzword. With the concept of identity dominating the current political discourse, so many words designed to help us describe our existence have been hijacked and reduced to Twitter fodder. The unique lenses through which we see the world are boiled down to talking points and funneled into political ads and fundraising emails. Intersectionality is among them. This term, coined by scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, describes the complex relationship between overlapping identities and the discrimination and privilege those identities precipitate. It has also become a political lightning rod, misconstrued as a tool to convince certain people that they were born victims and are powerless over their fates. But intersectionality isn’t just a buzzword. It’s not some sanitary academic theory either. Intersectionality describes the very real experience of standing in the crosswalk where multiple identities meet, frantically dodging the cars speeding by. For me, intersectionality was being called the N word while strolling down the sidewalk and being afraid the guy hurling it might beat me up for being gay too. Intersectionality was trying but failing to be a social chameleon, fighting desperately to be Black enough for some spaces, white enough for others, and masculine enough to escape any space unscathed. Intersectionality is reality for so many people. The faster we learn to celebrate the power of intersectional lived experiences, the more likely we are to build a future that has room for everyone. 2. You don’t have to save the world to earn your place in it. Growing up feeling out of place and struggling to find somewhere to belong, I did all the things I thought would help me assimilate. I got good grades. Joined every school club imaginable. Ran for student body office. Held down a part-time job. I suppose I thought that if I was just exceptional enough, those around me would forgive me when I was finally honest about who I was. After the Pulse nightclub shooting, that same natural desire to prove that I belong on Earth crept back. I poured myself into work, grinding my mental health down to frayed ends—as if life itself was an act of penance. The desire to prove ourselves is hardwired, especially for those whom society has historically told to work twice as hard for half as much. But the truth is that you don’t have to save the world to earn your place in it. You are worth more than simply what you can produce. Yes, your work matters. Your passion matters. Your contributions matter. But so does your joy. Your rest. Your peace. Don’t feel as though you have to lug the weight of the world on your shoulders and solve each crisis single-handedly in order to earn a place on Earth. You already belong here. 3. Forgiveness isn’t agreeing to absolve wrongdoing, it’s an act of unconditional love. I’ve always been one to hold grudges for far too long. I held a grudge against my dad for decades. Our relationship was strained while I was growing up—to put it nicely. He didn’t understand me and I didn’t understand him. He had trouble communicating his emotions and would often lash out irrationally. His words often stung during dinner table conversations and his silence after I came out cut deep. But in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting, I forgave him. I think he forgave me too. Not as an act of amnesia, shoving the hurt of the past into a mental waste bin. But as an act of love—an offer of grace. I didn’t know how many more birthday cards I would get from him or late-night phone calls. I couldn’t bear to waste another moment carrying the baggage of decades past. Forgiveness is a powerful tool and a necessary step in healing. When we lose someone we cared about, we have to forgive ourselves for waking up each day knowing that they will never have that chance again. We have to learn to forgive one another, and not just when it’s easy. Not as an agreement to absolve each other of the harm we’ve caused, but as an act of unconditional love. An offer to build a different kind of tomorrow together. 4. Dare to love with abandon. Love is such a journey. As children, we love recklessly, pouring our whole hearts into anything and everything. But, day by day, year by year, our love becomes more wary. We lose a puppy and the sting of grief makes us pull back a little. Our playground crush doesn’t feel the same way and the pain of rejection hardens our hearts just a touch. I loved my mother recklessly, and when she passed away when I was 12, it was as if my capacity for love itself was suddenly muted. That loss reshaped every relationship that followed. I dated hesitantly, made friends with caution—always afraid that one day, they might be gone. But my best friend Drew taught me to use that muscle again, to love unconditionally and courageously. There’s simply nothing like it. Humans are not immortal. Relationships end. Goodbyes never get any easier. But if we spend every moment with emotional walls raised high, petrified of what lurks on the next calendar page, we’ll miss everything. The uncontrolled laughter. The smiles until our cheeks hurt. The profound, soul-altering joy of connection. Nothing is forever. Dare to love with abandon while we’re here. 5. Community will save our lives. There is a pervasive culture of rugged individualism in America. “Pull yourself up by the bootstraps!” they’ll shout, as if every obstacle in life is designed as an individual event at a track meet. But that’s not how our species got to the top of the food chain. We worked together. Created language. Passed on knowledge. Solved problems hand-in-hand. Humankind has not progressed this far by forging a million individual paths through a tangled jungle. We did it by walking the path collectively. We would do well to remember that truth now when the temptation to pull society apart at the seams is high. We have to recommit to stitching our futures together. If we choose division and rancor, we’ll fail. If we choose chaos and mistrust, we’ll fall apart. Perhaps the most important lesson I learned in the wake of the Pulse tragedy was that we can’t get through these things alone. We have to stand, arms locked, shoulder to shoulder. I’ve always said that community has saved my life more than once. I think it’s what we need now too. Life isn’t an individual activity – it’s a team sport. We’re all in this thing together."" categories: ""find joy, lgbtQ+, memoir"" "

Book name: "" STFU: The Power of keeping your Mouth shut in a world that won't stop talking "" Book author name: ""Dan Lyons"" summary: ""Dan Lyons is the author of Disrupted: My Adventures in the Startup Bubble, a New York Times bestselling memoir, and Lab Rats: How Silicon Valley Made Work Miserable for the Rest of Us. He was also a writer for the hit HBO comedy series Silicon Valley. As a journalist, he spent a decade covering Silicon Valley for Forbes, ran tech coverage at Newsweek, and contributed to Fortune, the New York Times, Wired, Vanity Fair, and the New Yorker. He is a senior brand & content strategy director at DocuSign. What’s the big idea? Our noisy world has trained us to think that those who get in the last word win, when in fact it’s those who know how to stay silent who really hold the power. STFU is a book that unlocks this power and will change your life, freeing you to focus on what matters. New York Times bestselling author Dan Lyons combines leading behavioral science with actionable advice on how to communicate with intent, think critically, and open your mind and ears to the world around you. The 5 Key Insights 1. How you speak is who you are. 2. Someday we may use speech as a form of medicine. 3. You should quit social media, or at least dial it way back. 4. Most of the world’s most powerful and successful people are under talkers. 5. Listening is a superpower. 1. How you speak is who you are. Speech is how we define ourselves, and it shapes the way we perceive others. When you try to explain what someone is like, you usually define their personality by describing the way they speak. Fast talker or slow talker? Quiet or loud? Talkative or taciturn? Our speech is how we reveal our personality to the world. In a way, the way we speak is our personality. If you change the way you speak, you are in effect changing yourself. Talking is like breathing. You don’t think about it; you just do it. When you start paying attention to how you speak, this leads you to think about why you speak the way you do. You’re forcing yourself to become conscious of something that usually happens unconsciously. You’re doing the kind of work you might do through meditation or psychotherapy. You’re turning your attention inward. You’re engaging in self-reflection and self-examination. You’re figuring out who you are. 2. Someday we may use speech as a form of medicine. Matthias Mehl is a psychology researcher at the University of Arizona and he has spent the past 20 years studying the way people speak, searching for connections between the way we speak and our physical and emotional well-being. To do this, Mehl uses a device called an Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR). People carry it around with them for a few days, and it switches itself on at random times to capture what they’re saying. His first big experiment involved counting how many words people spoke in a day and who spoke more, men or women. At the time, a lot of people believed that women spoke way more than men, but Mehl found that there was no difference, both spoke about 16,000 words a day. Next, Mehl started studying not just how many words people spoke, but what they were talking about. A few years ago, he found that people who spend less time blabbing and engaging in small talk and devote more time to substantive conversations are happier. So much so that having good conversations, “might be a key ingredient to a satisfied life.” That was pretty intriguing, so Matthias tried something else. He set out to see if substantive conversations might also be related to physical health and remarkably enough, he discovered that there is a connection; people who have better conversations have healthier immune systems. To Mehl this made perfect sense; after all, speech is central to our being. He believes we’re going to learn a lot more in the coming years. One day, he says, instead of prescribing pills, your doctor might tell you, “Take two good conversations and call me in the morning.” 3. You should quit social media, or at least dial it way back. Social media companies use a business model that depends on keeping you online for as long as possible. To make the most money, they need to keep you “engaged,” which means instead of just reading, they need you to be posting, tweeting, sharing, and liking, and they’ve found that the best way to do that is to make you angry. That’s pretty bad, but even worse is that the anger you experience online carries back with you into your real life, creating an age of agitation. Have you noticed how much angrier the world is today than it was 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago? We’re all walking around feeling triggered and we feel helpless against it. Another problem is that it’s really hard to break free from social media because the apps are designed to be addictive. These apps give you little jolts of dopamine, a feel-good hormone. You start to crave that dopamine, and so you keep going back. Anna Lembke, a scientist at Stanford, treats digital addiction by putting people on a “dopamine fast,” where they stop using all screens, not just phones but also computers and TV, for a period of time. She says for some people these fasts are as effective as anti-depressants. The only way to regain control and protect yourself is to quit social media or at least dial it way back. That’s only part of the solution. In addition to social media, in this age of agitation, we are blitzed with tidal waves of content on streaming services, podcasts, and YouTube channels, all this information is overwhelming our brains. We also need to stop buying into the idea that we need to seek constant attention from other people online. That means pushing back against a world that does not just encourage us to talk too much but practically demands it. We have somehow come to believe that we should measure our success by our ability to gain attention. Everybody is out trying to get more followers on Twitter, or be a TikTok influencer. It creates a kind of desperate chase for attention that’s not good for our souls. Imagine how much better you would feel, and how much nicer the world would be, if we all managed to talk just a little less and listen a little more. 4. Most of the world’s most powerful and successful people are under-talkers. Powerful people don’t run around gabbing and shooting their mouths off—with a few big exceptions. Without naming them, you probably know who they are. Most powerful people hold back, they say less than they need to and when they do speak, they’re intentional about what they say. Barack Obama is one of the world’s greatest speakers, but he’s an even better listener. Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, and a relentless self-promoter, extols the virtue of being a shutter-upper in meetings. Apple CEO Tim Cook is famously quiet; he uses silence to draw information out of people. Silence is power. Notice that nobody ever talks about the “strong, talkative type.” Over-talkers are perceived as weak, incompetent, and unsure of themselves. They are also hated by their colleagues, and less likely to get promoted at work. If you want to be successful at work, learn how to STFU. Powerful people also know how to get comfortable with uncomfortable silences. Most of us hate it when a conversation goes silent. Researchers have found that it takes only four seconds for people to start feeling antsy. When that happens, we jump in and try to fill the void by saying something, anything. This is a trick that a lot of people use in negotiations; they will simply stop talking and sit there. They’re betting that the other person will feel uncomfortable and start talking, and with some luck will start negotiating against themselves, talking themselves into a bad deal. Car salesmen are trained to do this to customers to make you uncomfortable. Try doing it back to them and see what happens. 5. Listening is a superpower. Jennie Jerome, Winston Churchill’s mother, once contrasted the experience of having dinner with two big-shot British politicians: William Gladstone and Benjamin Disraeli. “When I left the dining room after sitting next to Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest man in England. But when I sat next to Disraeli, I left feeling that I was the cleverest woman.” If you ask the right questions, pay close attention to the answers, sit in silence, and let other people talk, people will reveal themselves to you. When people feel authentically seen and heard, they shine, just like Jennie Jerome did when she had dinner with Benjamin Disraeli. Imagine having that effect on everyone in your life! The thing is, it’s really difficult to become a good listener, and it’s exhausting to do it well. Sandra Bodin-Lerner is a master listener. She runs a group called the International Listening Association and teaches a course in listening at Kean University in New Jersey. Listening is also huge for parents. Next time your kid has a problem, resist the urge to try to solve it for them; just sit, be present with them, but be quiet. If you do speak, ask open-ended questions, and then listen, wait, and let them talk. Chances are they will work their way around to solving the problem on their own. When this works, it feels like magic. """

Book name: "" The World Behind the world: Consciousness, free will, and the Limits of Science "" Book author name: ""Dr. Erik Hoel"" summary: ""Dr. Erik Hoel is one of the Forbes 30 Under 30 in science and also a New York City Emerging Writers Fellow. His writing has appeared in The Atlantic, The Baffler, and The Daily Beast, among many others. Erik received his Ph.D. in neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University, has held a visiting scholarship at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, and is now a research professor at Tufts University where he studies consciousness and emergence. What’s the big idea? A fascinating exploration into how the brain creates our conscious experiences—potentially revolutionizing neuroscience and the future of technology—from a Forbes 30 Under 30 scientist. The Five Key Insights: 1.There are two fundamental perspectives on the world. 2. The intrinsic perspective didn’t start out fully developed (and neither did the extrinsic). 3. Reconciling the two perspectives requires a science of consciousness. 4. What if a theory of consciousness is impossible? 5. The scientific worldview doesn’t necessarily entail that you don’t have free will. 1. There are two fundamental perspectives on the world. The first is the extrinsic—this is the explanation of the world that’s about mechanism, about what causes what. An engineering diagram is extrinsic. There’s also the intrinsic perspective on the world. Thoughts, feelings, contemplations, emotions—these are all intrinsic phenomena. The intrinsic perspective is about consciousness, or what it is like to be you. Depending on what we want to explain, we shift fluidly between giving an extrinsic account or an intrinsic account. Sometimes, we may even accidentally use one for the other when we shouldn’t. A car breaks down and we say, “Talk to me, tell me what’s wrong, tell me what’s wrong?” But generally, such mixing is a mistake. It’s as if we have two extremely different lenses that we use to understand everyday things. Scientists, however, do try to reconcile the two perspectives—an effort called the search for a scientific theory of consciousness. The goal is to explain what the brain does, specifically, that allows it to have all the intrinsic qualities we have, like experiencing how ice cream tastes, or how music sounds. Not just processing the information, which can be given some extrinsic account like “neuron A fired, and then neuron B fired,” but transforming that information into consciousness. The intrinsic is often the topic of the humanities, from literature to art. In a way then, neuroscience is the bridge between the humanities and the sciences. It is only in the brain that the two perspectives are somehow, perfectly, fluidly, every day, at every waking moment, fully reconciled. It’s like we’re missing certain laws of nature—the law that governs how a certain neural firing is accompanied by, or transformed into, a certain experience. Which means there is a big hole in the middle of the world. 2. The intrinsic perspective didn’t start out fully developed (and neither did the extrinsic). Julian Jaynes discussed this in his cult classic book The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. His hypothesis is that consciousness arose from the integration of the two hemispheres around the Homeric age. It’s a wild hypothesis, and the only evidence is a careful textual analysis. While I think the support for consciousness arising in the Homeric era is very low, there is another hypothesis: that our descriptions of minds have grown increasingly deep and complex over time, just as our descriptions of the extrinsic universe has. One could go over the evidence for this forever, but it’s most salient to take a single example: essentially the same story told over and over throughout the ages. We can use “The Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor,” a tale from Ancient Egypt. It’s about a shipwreck on an island that contains a monstrous snake. Here’s from a translation: I uncovered my face and found that it was a snake that was coming. It was thirty cubits long… He opened his mouth to me while I was on my belly in his presence. He said to me, “Who brought you? Who brought you, commoner, who brought you to this island in the sea whose sides are in the water?” “The Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor” basically gets retold throughout the millennia, so many aspects of it in later tales, like the run-in with a monster, the strange island, crop up in The Odyssey. Odysseus and his men famously wander into the cave of a dangerous cyclops. But in the Odyssey, at least some of their intrinsic perspective is actually noted and told. But when he had busily performed his tasks, then he rekindled the fire, and caught sight of us, and asked: “Strangers, who are ye? Whence do ye sail over the watery ways?” … So he spoke, and in our breasts our spirit was broken for terror of his deep voice and monstrous self; yet even so I made answer and spoke to him. Let’s look at the same encounter between a man and a beast, this time in Ulysses by James Joyce. Ulyssesis, of course, a heavily modernized retelling of the Odyssey. What follows is sometimes called the “cyclops” part of Ulysses, with a pub being like the cave, and it’s also guarded by a “monster”—except it’s a dog—and owned by the “cyclops”—except it's just a huge guy with an eyepatch. . . . and there sure enough was the citizen [“cyclops”] up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink. There he is, says I . . . The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence. That’s the development of the intrinsic perspective, from what is a flat and unemotional reaction to a legitimate monster to describing every speck of thought in reaction to a common dog. 3. Reconciling the two perspectives requires a science of consciousness. In the modern age, the two perspectives on the world are highly developed. We can talk about minds with ease, we can talk about atoms with ease. But the perspectives are extremely different. So how do we reconcile them? That’s the job of what’s called the search for a scientific theory of consciousness. It was originally pioneered by two titans of science: Francis Crick and Gerald Edelman, both of whom won the Nobel Prize (for different reasons). They both fixated on consciousness as one of the last big unanswered questions in science: How does the brain generate experiences? Sensations? Thoughts? While this may seem the obvious goal of neuroscience, for a long time consciousness was verboten in science. It was worried that if the intrinsic perspective was allowed in, this might shatter the extrinsic one that science is based on. However, the good thing about winning a Nobel Prize is you can do whatever you want. So both men did, and through their efforts, they established the subfield of neuroscience that studies consciousness. Their approaches were different. Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, took a more conservative approach and began the search for what he called the “neural correlates of consciousness.” The idea was to examine the brain and look for correlations between neural activity and experiences, and that a theory would follow empirical work. Comparatively, Edelman wanted a big theoretical leap forward, and then to support them with empirical work. Two houses of research, if you will, one for Crick, the other for Edelman. While both have shown promise, ultimately as it stands, there is no final conclusion. There is no well-supported theory of consciousness. But thanks to them we have some guesses, some theories, and a growing scientific field. 4. What if a theory of consciousness is impossible? What if we can’t actually reconcile the two perspectives to our satisfaction? That’s a legitimate but rarely considered possibility. What this would mean is that a theory of consciousness cannot be had, or at least, aspects of consciousness cannot be explained by science. This would be quite surprising, given all the success that science has had in explaining the world. Phenomenon after phenomenon has been explained by science, but those were all extrinsic phenomena, not intrinsic ones. We have reason to believe this time it might be different. After all, there is an analogous situation in mathematics. Originally it was thought that mathematics, the purest of thought, could be set on epistemically unassailable grounds. But Kurt Gödel’s proofs showed that formal systems, like sets of axioms, were necessarily incomplete, and could not prove their own consistency. It’s not that mathematics is impossible, or a lie, it’s that it is fundamentally closed in certain abstract ways. The big problem was self-reference. An easy way to understand this is what is called the “Liar’s Paradox,” wherein someone declares “I am lying right now.” The sentence itself is the subject, and this recursion triggers a paradox: either they are lying, in which case they are telling the truth, or they are telling the truth, in which case they are lying. But if self-reference leads to paradox in mathematics, might it not do the same in science?Might science be necessarily, fundamentally, incomplete? Of course, science isn’t normally thought of as a formal system. But we can imagine it to be, for a moment, and think about what is happening when science is pointed back at the scientists themselves. It’s a case of recursion. Perhaps it too triggers a paradox. There is actually some evidence of other undecidable properties in nature—there are various proofs in fields like physics that some properties or answers are beyond science, but usually this has been proven for edge cases that don’t seem to matter too much to working scientists. But what if consciousness itself is like that? That would perfectly explain why consciousness is so difficult to explain in scientific terms, since by embedding the intrinsic in the extrinsic we trigger the same sort of abstract recursion that Gödel’s proofs relied upon, and we end in paradox. I call this “scientific incompleteness.” While I can’t prove it’s the case, there is enough suggestive evidence there to worry it’s true, and that may mean not only that we might never possess a scientific theory of consciousness, but that we might never fully understand the universe at large. We might be living in a paradox. 5. The scientific worldview doesn’t necessarily entail that you don’t have free will. This is important because such arguments actually affect people's behavior. Studies have shown that a belief in free will is associated with healthy psychological profiles, like being unlikely to be depressed, and so on. Usually, free will denial is given a form of something like this: “Since you are made of physical atoms, and your atoms are following the laws of physics, and they are the ones that cause everything you do, you yourself don’t cause anything.” Another example might be: “Since it is possible to predict the future state of the universe from the current state, your actions are predetermined.” Often this is framed as the scientific worldview itself ensuring that this is true. However, these sorts of arguments have not reckoned with some major scientific changes in our understanding of the world, just in the last few decades. Combined, these major changes in our understanding do give us something that arguably looks a lot like a scientific argument for free will. First, there has been the development of what’s called computational irreducibility. The conclusion of this field of complex system analysis can be summed up as: “While a given system might be following predetermined rules, it may be completely impossible, even in principle, to predict what the system will do unless you watch what it does.” This is why, along with chaos theory, which is related, no matter how fine-grained our measurements of the weather become, we can never actually predict the weather. We just have to wait and see what happens. But it seems quite likely the brain satisfies these sorts of properties as well, and it would be impossible to predict ahead of time. You simply have to wait and see. While perhaps some perfect model could be used for prediction, this doesn’t eliminate the unpredictability of that new model itself. That is, the science of complex systems means that the argument—you don’t have free will because it is theoretically possible to predict your actions—has a definition of “prediction” that is arguably bled dry entirely, and is toothless. The second major change is even less well-known, which is an improved grasp of causation and causal modeling. This has led to a better understanding of what does what. But it’s also shown a counterintuitive effect. Under the right conditions, “causal emergence” can occur, where the higher levels of a physical system can have irreducible causal power, not just the lower ones. It renders untrue statements like “You didn’t move your arm, your atoms did it.” Because actually your atoms don’t appropriately account for the causation. Causal emergence comes when the higher levels of description of a system, like a psychological description of a brain, add error correction into the causal relationships of the parts of the system or its effects. It was discovered by a team of researchers, including myself in graduate school. These two changes mean that a lot of the more common and powerful arguments that the scientific worldview rules out free will are untrue. Especially as it’s highly possible that the brain itself satisfies these conditions, and has these properties: that is, it is both fundamentally unpredictable and causally emergent. Either way, until that’s figured out, we should hold off declaring free will deceased."""

What’s the big idea? Based on over a decade of groundbreaking research, Your Future Self describes the mental mistakes we make in thinking about the future and gives us practical advice for imagining our best future so we can make that vision a reality. The 5 Key Insights: 1. We may think of our future selves as if they are entirely different people. 2. When it comes to long-term decisions, what matters is the type of relationship that we have with that future person. 3. Try to make your future self seem closer. 4. Stay on course by adding constraints to our future behavior. 5. Make present-day sacrifices feel easier to undertake. 1. We may think of our future selves as if they are entirely different people. Emily Pronin, a psychology professor from Princeton, has conducted a research study where student participants were asked to describe a meal that they were eating at that moment. Most people described it through what's known as a first-person perspective, how they saw the meal in front of them. Then the same students were asked to imagine a meal that they would eat in the distant future, sometime after they were 40 years old. In this activity, they were about four times as likely to use the third-person perspective, seeing themselves as if they were another person in the scene. What is interesting about this is that it suggests that, in our mind's eye, our future self looks like another person. In my own research, I have also found the same results. My colleagues and I found that by using neuroimaging methods, the brain activity that arises when we think about our future selves is more on par with the brain activity that arises when we think about another person. As an analogy, we may imagine our future selves as another person. 2. When it comes to long-term decisions, what matters is the type of relationship that we have with that future person. There are many different ways to treat other people in our lives. When it comes to interacting with complete strangers, we might find ourselves being somewhat selfish or self-interested. It’s not that we’re bad people, we just don’t have a connection to them. If someone you didn’t know that well, like a coworker, asked you to help them move this weekend, it’s likely you’d come up with a million excuses not to help them. It doesn't mean that you are selfish, but it does mean that in some situations, you may act in a self-interested way. If that is how we see our future selves, that is, if they seem like strangers to us, then it makes sense that we might not do things that benefit them—things like overeating, overspending, or undersaving. The caveat to this is that there are people in our lives whom we do act generously toward. People like our children and our parents and our closest friends and even the coworker with whom we may really connect. When it comes to long-term decisions, if we think about our future selves as if they are others we are close to, then we will be more open to doing things for their benefit. My own research and research conducted by others has confirmed this theory. People who feel a greater sense of similarity and connection to their future selves are, for example, more likely to have accrued assets, to act ethically, to report greater subjective health, life satisfaction, and meaning in life. Those findings remain true even when you take into account other factors. 3. Try to make your future self seem closer. One way to do this is by enhancing how vivid your future self is. Anne Napolitano, the best-selling fiction author, started writing letters to her future self when she was 14 years old. She wrote a letter to herself ten years older; and then after ten years, she read the letter and wrote a new letter to her future self. Not only does that take an incredible amount of commitment, but she also told me in an interview that she often wanted to read the letters early, but she never did. For her, the act of writing a letter to her future self and also reading letters from her past self helped her identify the core values that she found truly important, keeping her on the right path. One way that we can do this, according to research, is to write a letter to our future selves, and then step into the shoes of our future selves, and write a letter from them. This is an activity that can help make the future more vivid while helping us feel less anxiety in the present about all of the uncertainties that remain for the years to come. 4. Stay on course by adding constraints to our future behavior. We can make life easier for our future selves by making grand plans now to ease our future lives. For example, eating more healthily in the evenings now will help our future selves look back and say, “I did a good job eating healthily.” However, we also have a present version of ourselves who will inevitably screw things up and snack late at night. We can counteract this by engaging in smart commitment devices. Dave Krippendorff, a graduate student at MIT, lived across the street from a Whole Foods. He often found himself sneaking out of his house when he was faced with a difficult problem set and buying snack after snack. Over time his waist got bigger and his wallet got thinner. He wanted to figure out a way to stop this behavior so he invented a little safe with an electronic timer on top. He put the snacks inside it and locked it away for a period of time, anywhere from a minute to ten days. He took his idea to Shark Tank, won financing, and left his high-paying job to start Kitchen Safe. He's found over the years that people use the safe for so many different things outside of kitchen snacks, that he has rebranded it kSafe. The beauty of this product is that it puts some constraints on our future behavior. In fact, I use it to lock away my phone during dinner times so that I'm more present with my family. Commitment devices can be incredibly powerful. However, to adopt a commitment device, it relies on us to choose something that gives us sufficient enough punishment so that we don't engage in an undesirable behavior, but also that doesn't punish us so severely that our current selves fail to adopt the commitment device altogether. 5. Make present-day sacrifices feel easier to undertake. For any of the trade-offs that exist between our current and our future selves, it's always our current self who has to make the sacrifice and our future self who may or may not benefit from those decisions. It's almost like being in a bad relationship where you're the one who's always doing things for the other person. One way around this is to try to reframe things so that those sacrifices don't feel so hard to undertake. During a recent research study conducted with colleagues, I worked with a fintech company to try and see if new users of its app would sign up for an automatic savings account. We asked these new users if they wanted to save $150 a month, $35 a week, or $5 a day. Four times as many people signed up for the account when it was framed as $5 a day, in part because it certainly feels like a much easier sacrifice to make. If we want to do right by our future selves, we need to come up with ways to ease the tension between our current and future selves."" categories: ""find joy, happiness , personal development, psychology, the future"" "

Book name: "" The Pop-up Pitch: The Two-Hour Creative sprint to the Most Persuasive presentation of your life. "" Book author name: ""Dan Roam"" summary: ""Over the past several years, Dan Roam has written a series of books on how to help business professionals become better thinkers and communicators through the power of our visual mind. He helps people better understand how to see the simple patterns that allow us to share powerful ideas effectively. This book combines the key lessons he has learned over the last 20 years of mastering visual science and the science of telling a story. He has advised organizations like Microsoft, IBM, and the White House, and also has appeared on major news outlets like CNN, ABC, NPR, and more. 1. When it comes to persuasion, a story always beats a presentation. There's something in a story that makes us feel safe: something familiar, reassuring and clear. We need stories to organize the world around us, to present ourselves and our organizations, and to untangle crisis and complexity. Stories are more important now than ever, as the world has become more and more complex. And yet, in business, no one really teaches us how to tell them. One of the greatest teachers of storytelling is George Lucas, the creator of the Star Wars universe. Although it was a long time ago, I remember that when I first saw Star Wars, I was so mesmerized that I didn't even realize I was having a story told to me. I just went along for the ride. So did the rest of the world, making Star Wars one of humanity's most popular story series of all time. Yet there's another story about George Lucas that many people don't know. When he was a teenager, he raced cars all the time. Until one day, when he crashed his car. In that crash, his heart stopped and he died. But as fate would have it, bystanders pulled his body from the wreckage, and doctors were able to revive him. During that brief time of death, George Lucas (and this is a direct quote from him) said that what he realized is from that day on, he always felt like he was given an extra day. He wanted to pay attention during those extra days to better understand what made the world good. One of the things that he realized makes the world good is when people work together and support each other to achieve something. People are happier and more successful when they work together. And that was the story he decided to tell—the story that ultimately became Star Wars. A simple story of misfit friends who work together to literally save the universe. I supposed George Lucas could have put that into a presentation with a PowerPoint in which he talked about how we can achieve more effectively when we work as teams. He could have used data and charts and frameworks, and wrapped it all up with a page of summary bullet points. All of that would have been lovely, but it would never have been Star Wars. 2. The best stories are the simplest to tell. The best story of your life is going to be one of the simplest to tell, because the best stories follow a template. The best template, it turns out, is only ten statements long. It could be ten slides, ten pages, or ten paragraphs, but it can always be told as a journey of ten steps. It's built from the beginning to a middle to an end. It is a classic tale that humans have been telling each other since the beginning of time. Back to George Lucas: where did he get the idea for how he would tell the story of Star Wars? He got the storyline when he was back in school after recuperating from his car crash. In community college, he happened to read a book by Joseph Campbell called The Hero with a Thousand Faces. In that book, Campbell (a famed anthropologist who had traveled the world studying the greatest stories and myths of all time) realized that there was a common storyline he called, “the monomyth.” That storyline has become known colloquially as “the hero's journey.” If you actually look into what the monomyth is, and how Campbell described it, there is a hero, but he or she isn’t what you’d necessarily expect in the sense of true heroic scale and achievement. The real story in the hero’s journey is that the hero is us. We are the heroes of our own life. Whatever we seek to achieve, be it simply the act of growing up, going out into the world to make our own way—whether to find a job or raise a family or achieve success—in the context of the hero's journey, that is the act of a hero. If you look at this classic monomyth structure, you can combine it with other ideas that are equally powerful, like behavioral economics, classic American sales techniques, and good old positive persuasion. When you read about behavioral economics from people like Daniel Kahneman and Dan Ariely, you see that there are many irrational biases in the stories we tell ourselves as we make decisions. These biases can often be predicted along lines that look a lot like key turns in the hero’s journey. Weave in the kinds of positive messages we like to hear when we're willing to be persuaded, and the patterns become even clearer. When it comes to positive persuasion, the hero's journey, behavioral economics, and classic salesmanship all end up being quite parallel. If you spin them together, you can derive a simple ten-turn emotional journey. Those ten turns form the backbone of a simple story for positively persuading someone to take a new action or to think in a different way. I call this storyline the “Ten Page Pitch.” 3. Your visual mind already knows your story. Remember where I began, with my love of the power of pictures? I am convinced that your visual mind already knows more about what you think than your verbal mind is willing to admit. To test this theory, start sketching. All you need to do to unlock the power of your visual mind is to sketch out your ideas as you talk about them. Draw simple stick figures and circles and arrows and boxes. Tell the story as you start to draw. You’ll find that your visual mind already knows much of the story that you want to tell. It's estimated by cognitive scientists and neurobiologists that roughly half of your brain is dedicated to processing vision. More of your brain is there to help process vision than any other thing that you do. Think about that. Think about what might happen if you could seize the power of your visual mind, which already spends so much time seeing the world clearly. If you could seize that power and put it into your storytelling, you would be amazed with what you already know, how easy it is to communicate those ideas to yourself, and then how easy to craft that visual story to share with someone else. That's big—and you can. When you combine visuals and story, telling the best story of your life is pretty simple. If you just follow the template to create the ten-turn journey and add pictures, you’re not just going to create a ten-paragraph story, you’re going to take us from beginning to middle to end through positive persuasion, and you’re going to amplify it through your simplest possible pictures. 4. All meetings are equal, but some are more equal than others. As I think about the thousands of meetings I’ve gone through, as many of you have, I see that they fall into a pretty clear set of categories. Some meetings are just about delivering information. Some meetings are about making a decision or solving a problem. Some meetings are about teaching a new idea, and others are about pitching a new idea. Here's the thing: they're all a little bit different depending on how you interact with the other people you're meeting with, how much of the meeting is dedicated towards collaboration and feedback, and how much is dedicated towards good old presenting and teaching. All of those meetings, at a core level, require you, as the person who's leading the meeting or running the presentation, to have the ability to persuade. Even if you're just delivering a new piece of information, you still have to persuade people that it's important so they should take action on it. If you're trying to teach someone, you have to persuade them that the idea is a good idea and it may replace or complement or amplify an existing idea. Certainly, if you're selling something, that is all about persuasion. So, all of these meetings exist, and what's important for presenters is knowing what's most important about our meeting so as to create the story that best suits that particular meeting. 5. When it comes to persuasion, be positive. There's a lot of negative energy out there, and we see how much attention it gathers. But you know what the good news is about being human? In the end, we are always driven to do more good and meaningful things through positive persuasion than through negative persuasion. Always. In Daniel Kahneman’s book Thinking Fast and Slow, he gives an example about something called “positive framing.” Within the whole world of behavioral economics, what we're beginning to see is if you want people to do well at something, if you positively frame the original opportunity or challenge, as opposed to negatively framing it, people's action will be much more positive, and will deliver a far better result. The big ideas culminate to this: if you want to get someone to take action, then tell them a story from a positive perspective, make sure that story fits the meeting, takes advantage of visual imagery, follows the steps of the fundamental ten-step journey. And make sure, in the end, what you share is a story. Don't ask yourself, what is my presentation about? Ask yourself, what is the story that my presentation wants to tell? Begin there, and you will create, in less than two hours, the best presentation you've ever given in your whole life. That's why I call it the “pop up pitch.” """
